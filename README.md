# Code-Quiz
Welcome to the Code Quiz challenge.
In this challenge I have created a code quiz to test the user's knowledge of basic coding concepts.

Users can save their initials and their score to their local storage. They gain 1 point for a correct answer and lose 1 point for an incorrect answer. Users cannot have negative points, so the lowest possible score is a 0 and a perfect score is 5.

The quiz can be found at https://graciaan.github.io/Code-Quiz/
